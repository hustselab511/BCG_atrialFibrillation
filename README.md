# FabosNet Guide

FabosNet model is used for Ballistocardiogram signal detection of atrial fibrillation.

## Advantages
- By converting the original BCG signal into its wavelet transform temporal-spectrogram using the Morlet wavelet transform, we can enhance the local information density and effectively extract critical imaging features.
- We present a novel model that integrates atrial fibrillation (AF)-specific characteristics from different frequency bands and time domains, allowing for effective differentiation between atrial fibrillation and sporadic arrhythmias.
- The proposed FabosNet is highly adaptable to various sampling lengths, achieving an accuracy of 95.26% on signal segments as short as 5 seconds.  This offers a promising solution for early AF screening in real-world applications.
